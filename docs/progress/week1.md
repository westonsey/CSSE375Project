# Part 1. Team Planning of the Week
**Planning Date**: 03/07/2024

**Items Planned**:
1. Use java for game development and tests and maybe spring for front end
2. Meet on Sunday night to Plan out the weeks work, check in on Thursday nights
3. Be very communicative on Teams

# Part 2. Team Progress of the Week
**Evaluation Date**: 03/03/2024

**Item Progress**:
1. Set up team Repository
2. Chose to do Catan and chose out Framework for the game
3. Set up meeting times

# Intructor feedback
## Progress evaluation :scroll:
Please make sure that this course requires the use of Java and JUnit. Exceptions can be made for the frontend. If your team insists on writing tests in Python, please make sure to propose the following by March 13 (Wed):
1. A static analysis linter for Python that detects bad coding practices
2. A style linter for Python that detects stylistic issues
3. A code coverage tool for Python, and
4. A mutation testing tool for Python.

## Suggested next action items :fist:
1)  Don't forget to add the workflow badge to README
2)  thoroughly understanding the game rules, and
3)  starting to work on the requirement docs (which I can tell from your Project board that you are already planning on it!)

## Highlight of your team's work :partying_face:
Regardless of my recommendation of changing the programming language, it is good to see that you are passionate and interested in other frameworks!

## Improvements to consider :star:
Very minor -- but please make sure to include individual contributions from Week 2 onward. I understand that maybe everything in Week 1 was done as a team only so there is no documentation of individual contributions.
