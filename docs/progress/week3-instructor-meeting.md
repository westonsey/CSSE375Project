# Instructor pre-meeting inspections
1. Project board indicates reasonable planning and progress. See Recommendations and Other Notes below for detailed suggestions.
2. From the Project board, PRs, active branches, and the commit history, it is not clear to me whether all the team members have been contributing equally. A question to ask during the meeting.

## Recommendations and Other Notes
1. Picked a GUI library that the team feels the most comfortable with.
2. No BVA, TDD, and test cases are needed for the GUI code.
3. No BVA, TDD, and test cases are needed for getters and setters, unless the getters and setters do more than just getting and setting the instance variables.
4. Implement the GUI part alongside the backend development.
5. Each task in the Projects board should also have descriptions of the classes and methods involved. For instance, for "Board generation functionality#33", Board class seems to be the main class under development. What are the main methods to be developed? What are their signatures? What are other classes involved? What are the interfaces used between the class under development and external classes?
6. The team uses Teams to document planning and the details
