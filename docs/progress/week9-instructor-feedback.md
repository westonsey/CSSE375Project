# Instructor Feedback Week 9

Evaluation date: 5/9

Evaluation artifact: the main branch

1. Some methods can be broken into multiple private methods. For instance, the methods in CountCollection, when there are multiple if bodies, each can be encapsulated in a private method with meaningful method name describing what the computation is. Or maybe it makes sense to have two if bodies into one method, like the first two if in the remove method. Similarly, the getHexes method in VertexLocation class.

All of the above would fall under "Martin's standard", which is a criteria for A.

2. Make sure i18n is in progress, since they are not found yet in the main branch.

Good job overall!
